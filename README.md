### ⚡ 3-Minute Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/pamosima/network-mcp-docker-suite.git
cd network-mcp-docker-suite

# 2. Configure servers you need (see individual server READMEs for details)
cp meraki-mcp-server/.env.example meraki-mcp-server/.env    # For Meraki integration
cp catc-mcp-server/.env.example catc-mcp-server/.env        # For Catalyst Center
# ... configure other servers as needed

# 3. Deploy servers

## 💻 Usage

### 🤖 Example Prompts

Here's a real-world example of how to interact with the MCP servers using natural language:

#### **Network Troubleshooting Example**

**User Prompt:**
```
Check why wlsn-access-1.dna.its-best.ch is unreachable from Cisco Catalyst Center.
```

**AI Assistant Response:**
The AI assistant automatically uses both MCP servers working together:

1. **Catalyst Center MCP Server** - Checks device status and issues
2. **IOS XE MCP Server** - Direct SSH access to verify physical layer  
3. **Multi-Server Correlation** - AI correlates data to identify root cause

**Resolution Identified:**
- ✅ Device is UP and operational (verified via SSH)
- ✅ Physical connectivity confirmed via CDP
- ❌ **Root Cause**: IP address mismatch in Catalyst Center inventory
- 🔧 **Solution**: Update device IP and re-sync

#### **More Example Prompts**

| Scenario | Example Prompt | Servers Used |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Device Configuration** | *"Configure VLAN 100 on all access switches in Building A"* | Catalyst Center + IOS XE |
| **Performance Analysis** | *"Show me network latency for our main website over the last 6 hours"* | ThousandEyes |
| **Security Compliance** | *"Show me all non-compliant devices and their authorization profiles"* | ISE + Catalyst Center |
| **Infrastructure Audit** | *"Generate a report of devices that don't match between NetBox and reality"* | NetBox + Catalyst Center |
| **Capacity Planning** | *"Show me bandwidth utilization trends across all sites"* | Meraki + Catalyst Center |

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Container Security
- ✅ Runs as non-root user
- ✅ Security options enabled (`no-new-privileges`)
- ✅ Resource limits configured
- ✅ Network isolation via Docker networks

### Production Security
- 🔒 API keys loaded from environment variables only
- 🔒 Network isolation via Docker networks
- 🔒 Role-based access control (where supported)

For production deployments, consider:
1. **Secrets Management**: Use Docker secrets or external secret managers
2. **Network Security**: Implement proper firewall rules and network segmentation
3. **Monitoring**: Set up comprehensive logging and monitoring
4. **Updates**: Regular security updates and vulnerability scanning

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Servers not responding:**
```bash
# Check if containers are running
./deploy.sh status all

# Check logs for errors
./deploy.sh logs all

# Restart problematic services
./deploy.sh restart <profile>
```

**MCP clients can't connect:**
```bash
# Verify endpoints are accessible
curl http://localhost:8000/mcp

# Check network connectivity
docker network ls
docker network inspect <network_name>

# Restart MCP client (Cursor, LibreChat, etc.)
```

**Configuration issues:**
- Check individual server READMEs for detailed troubleshooting
- Verify API credentials and permissions
- Check network connectivity to target systems

## 📊 Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks

```bash
# Check all services
./deploy.sh status all

# Monitor resource usage
docker stats

# View recent logs
./deploy.sh logs all | tail -100
```

### Updates

```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull

# Rebuild and restart
docker-compose up -d --build

# Clean up old images
docker system prune -f
```
